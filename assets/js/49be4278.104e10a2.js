After the data is exfiltrated out of a victims device(s), they can be reused in other attacks against the victim (logging into a bank account, etc.). If not, then this data is offered for sale on dark web marketplaces. There are currently some popular infostealer malware out there, such as Redline, Vidar, and Raccoon. As more and more infostealer malware are deployed, the more stealer logs are created. This leads to more information being offered for sale. Similar to data breaches, after some time, these are available for free. From my research in stealer logs, they are mostly available through dark-web marketplaces and through Telegram channels.
