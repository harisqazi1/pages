This takes the longest time due to the amount of data being transferred. After the full backup is completed, the next two backup operations become available to you: incremental backups and differential backups. Incremental backups will copy only the data that has changed since the last backup operation of any type. Incremental backups keep on adding files that are new or modified from the last backup. Incremental backups do not take into account if you previously did a full backup or an incremental backup. Differential backups, on the other hand, do take that into account. A differential is similar to an incremental in the first time it is run. "However, each time it is run afterwards, it will continue to copy all data changed since the previous full backup.
