It ended up being a choice of C vs Rust. Eventually, I settled on Rust seeing how DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and a lot of other projects were prioritizing Rust due to its memory-safe nature. Now that the language was chosen, the next step was using that language for a personal use case: disk labels. When you start data hoarding, you end up with a lot of drives. Keeping track of which drive has what password gets complicated when you have drives that look or are similar. One solution to this is to have code words labeled on your drives to identify them more easily. As such, I wrote a program (inspired by the NSA's covert operation code words) that can generate those code words for you, the caveat being that the output format is one that works for me. The code, as always, is open source: ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://codeberg.org/Harisfromcyber/Media/src/branch/main/label_it",children:"https://codeberg.org/Harisfromcyber/Media/src/branch/main/label_it"}),".
