It ended up being a choice of C vs Rust. Eventually, I settled on Rust seeing how DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and a lot of other projects were prioritizing Rust due to its memory-safe nature. Now that the language was chosen, the next step was using that language for a personal use case: disk labels. When you start data hoarding, you end up with a lot of drives. Keeping track of which drive has what password gets complicated when you have drives that look or are similar. One solution to this is to have code words labeled on your drives to identify them more easily. As such, I wrote a program (inspired by the NSA\'s covert operation code words) that can generate those code words for you, the caveat being that the output format is one that works for me. The code, as always, is open source: https://codeberg.org/Harisfromcyber/Media/src/branch/main/label_it. The steps to run the code and what it fully does are in the README.md for that repository.\\n\\nOne smaller update to the site was done under the \\"Configurations\\" category. I have now added containerized applications that I use there: https://www.harisqazi.com/configurations/containers. As a Linux user, a lot of the technical solutions you use end up being really easy due to the \\"flat\\" nature of Linux (i.e. you, the user, can access any aspect of the OS - easily). Due to this, the list of containerized applications is low. As with other configurations listed on the site, I will update those as my own tech stack changes.\\n\\n\\\\- Haris"},{"id":"gaming-and-backups","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/gaming-and-backups","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-28-gaming-and-backups.md","title":"Linux Gaming and Backups","description":"After some back and forth, I am finally deciding to move back to Linux for gaming.

That can be found on https://www.harisqazi.com/blog/rss.xml. After watching others (Jeff Geerling, crankysec, etc.) use RSS, I felt like I needed one for my work as well. I\'ll most likely be posting blogs as summaries or some key takeaways from the work I have in the documentation section. \\n\\nI now also have a privacy policy. This was partially inspired by Michael Bazzell\'s IntelTechniques site. I wanted to be clear what I was doing with the end users\' data - nothing. I think having a privacy policy makes it clear what your intentions are, but also allows for a form of checks and balances. I tell you I don\'t have access to your data. In return, since the source code is available publicly (https://codeberg.org/harisfromcyber/pages/), you can hold me up to that.\\n\\nI previously also had multiple licenses on the portfolio: one for the code, and one for the content. All of it is now under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. It allows you to share the content, even commercially, but attribution must be given. I spend days on my work, and would like to get credit if you were to use my work. I try my best to cite others in all my work as well. I feel like that is how the open-source world should be: give credit where it is due.\\n\\nThat is pretty much a summary of the big changes. I did a bit of housekeeping and removed all of my write-ups. \\n\\nSee you in the next one!\\n\\n\\\\- Haris"}]}}')}}]);
